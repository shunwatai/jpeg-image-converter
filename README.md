####This is the assignment of "COMP3422 Creative Digital Media Design"

This is a simple python program for convert images in bmp,png etc. to jpeg
format. Actually, JPEG image is also accepted as source, but please select another output folder to avoid overwite the original image.

It allows user the select multiple images to convert.

I used Python3.5 to program it, ```Tkinter``` library for GUI, ```PIL``` library for image
processing.

####How to run this program
To run this program, you need to install python 3.5, then open terminal/cmd and
install PIL library by following command 

    pip install Pillow 
    
Then try to run this program ```python pyJpegConverter.py```.

There is a exe program provided which generated by ```pyinstaller```, you can
try to run it directly on Windows. (ONLY TESTED ON WIN7)
